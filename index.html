            Usagi Tsukino may seem like an air-headed crybaby, but she is really a savior. We meet Usagi on a morning when she is late for school.
            She panics, rushes out of the house and is still late for role call. She then proceeds to get in trouble for eating in the hallway and poor grades.
            Usagi soon discovers that she has special abilities. Other girls are drawn to her and find they, too, have special abilities.
            Together, they fight evil and find out they are the reincarations of the original gaurdians of the moon princess.
            Our immature protagonist comes to terms with some strange realities and accepts her destiny whole-heartedly.

         <h2>Growth & Morals</h2>
         <p>
            We see continuous growth in each of the characters in this story. Usagi, however, experienced the most growth.
            She has always had a fairly strong moral compass. Sure, she was very immature in the beginning, but who isn't when they're a kid?
            From the start, she fights for love and for justice. She is also a bit irresponsible and constantly late.
            On the surface she is just a silly girl, but this <i>literal child</i> is subjected to watching those around her die again and again.
            Usagi may be whiney and dramatic, but do not allow that to overshawdow how caring and brave she is.
            Sailor Moon sacrifices herself multiple times to save her friends and Earth.

         <h2>Tweens Fighting Evil</h2>
         <p>
            Sailor Moon may be a pretty show, but it is also full of horrors. 
            The forces of evil constantly try to steal the vital energy of citizens.
            These evil forces tend to conjure up some super creepy monsters that are cleverly in theme.
            Other monsters.... are just odd and offputting?

         <p>
            The forces of evil which go against our heroes come primarily from space.  Our main characters all lived on the moon in a previous life.
            The sailor gaurdians are able to teleport if they all work together.
