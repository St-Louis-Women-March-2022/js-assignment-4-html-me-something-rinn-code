            <h2>Normal girl or Celestial Being Reincarnated?</h2>
           Usagi Tsukino may seem like an air-headed crybaby, but she is really a savior. We meet Usagi on a morning when she is late for school. <br>
           She panics, rushes out of the house and is still late for role call. She then proceeds to get in trouble for eating in the hallway and poor grades. <br>
           Usagi soon discovers that she has special abilities. Other girls are drawn to her and find that they, too, have special abilities.<br>
           Together, they fight evil and find out they are the reincarations of the original gaurdians of the moon princess.<br>
           Our immature protagonist comes to terms with some strange realities and accepts her destiny whole-heartedly.

         <h2>Growth & Morals</h2>
         <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">
            We see continuous growth in each of the characters in this story. Usagi, however, experienced the most growth.<br> 
            She has always had a fairly strong moral compass. Sure, she was very immature in the beginning, but who isn't when they're a kid?<br>
            From the start, she fights for love and for justice. She is also a bit irresponsible and constantly late.<br>
            On the surface she is just a silly girl, but this <i>literal child</i> is subjected to watching those around her die again and again.<br>
            Usagi may be whiney and dramatic, but do not allow that to overshawdow how caring and brave she is.<br>
            Sailor Moon sacrifices herself multiple times to save her friends and Earth.<br>

         <h2>Tweens Fighting Evil</h2>
         <p>
            Sailor Moon may be a pretty show, but it is also full of horrors. 
            The forces of evil constantly try to steal the vital energy of citizens.<br>
            These evil forces tend to conjure up some super creepy monsters that are cleverly in theme.
            Other monsters.... are just odd and offputting?<br>
            The forces of evil which go against our heroes come primarily from space.  
            Our main characters all lived on the moon in a previous life.<br>
            The sailor gaurdians are able to teleport if they all work together.
            This show demostrates how teamwork and friendship can save the world. <br>
